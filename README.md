# OTT Movie Recommendation System
This is a data analysis project that builds a movie recommendation system based on user ratings and preferences. The goal of this project is to provide personalized movie recommendations to users of Over-The-Top (OTT) platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Movies on Streaming Platforms dataset (attached in the repo), which consists of movies available on various OTT platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Disney+ as of July 2021. The dataset includes information on the movie title, year of release, runtime, genre, rating, and platform availability. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned for use in this project.

# Methodology
The movie recommendation system is built using a combination of Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering techniques. Collaborative Filtering is used to identify users with similar movie preferences and recommend movies that those users have rated highly. Content-Based Filtering is used to recommend movies that are similar in content to movies that the user has already rated highly.

# Code
The code for this project is written in Python 3 and is contained in the OTT movie recommendation system.ipynb Jupyter notebook. The notebook uses several popular data analysis libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.

The notebook is divided into several sections, including data loading and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building. Each section includes detailed explanations of the code and its functionality.

# Results
The results of the movie recommendation system are presented in the notebook using interactive widgets that allow users to enter their preferences and receive personalized movie recommendations based on those preferences.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Content-Based Filtering technique to build a movie recommendation system for OTT platforms. The code and results can be easily replicated or modified for use in other recommendation system projects.
